    Assignment Title:       Program 18
    Assignment Description: Awesome Square
                            This program ultimately checks the sum of the rows
                            of a square to ensure the sum is equal for all rows

*******************************************************************************
    Data Abstraction:
        * ints declared for test case count, square size, value, row and total
        sums
    Input:
        * Ask user for test case count, ask square size, then ask value until
          square size is reached, then ask square size again until test case
          count is achieved.
    Process:
        * Ask square size until test case count is reached
        * Ask value, add to row sum, add row sum to total sum
        * If total sum divided by square size is equal to the row sum, print
          "Awesome" else print "Not Awesome"
    Output:
        *  Print "Awesome" if the sum of all rows are equal,  "Not Awesome" if
           they are not all equal.
    Assumptions:
        * It is assumed that, having been prompted to do so, the user will
          correctly input data
